    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Triceratops:</strong> Meet the three-horned face! Triceratops was
      a bulky herbivore from the Late Cretaceous, famous for its impressive
      frill and three prominent facial horns. These features likely played a
      role in defense against predators like Tyrannosaurus rex and in social
      display. With its sturdy build, Triceratops was a formidable plant-eater.

    <p>
      <strong>Stegosaurus:</strong> Easily recognized by the distinctive row of
      bony plates running along its back and the spiked tail, Stegosaurus was a
      large, herbivorous dinosaur of the Late Jurassic period. These plates
      likely served for display and defense, while its thagomizer (the spiky
      tail) could deliver a powerful blow to any would-be attacker.

      <h2>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a colossal predator, the undisputed king of the Late Cretaceous!
        With its massive jaws packed with serrated teeth and powerful hind legs,
        Tyrannosaurus rex was a fearsome hunter. Though its tiny arms might look
        comical, this iconic dinosaur was a force to be reckoned with,
        dominating its ecosystem.
